## Usage

The root endpoint `/` redirects to a swagger documentation page where you can test the API.

## Installation

You can run the api locally the way you'd do it with any go project.

```bash
go mod download

```

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY= # your_openai_api_key
ENVIRONMENT= # 'prod' or 'dev'
```

Then you can run the server with:

```bash
# install swaggo globally to generate swagger documentation on build
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag

# If building to prod(strips debug symbols)
make build-prod
# else you can use
make build

# run the server
make run
```
